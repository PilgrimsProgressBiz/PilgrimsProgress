## What is Counseling Using an Adlerian Individual Psychology Approach?

Adlerian individual psychology, developed by Alfred Adler, is a holistic approach to counselling that emphasizes understanding the unique motivations and goals of each individual. This approach focuses on the belief that human behavior is purposeful and goal-directed. Adlerian counseling helps individuals gain insight into their behaviours, thoughts, and emotions to foster personal growth, overcome challenges, and achieve a sense of belonging and significance.

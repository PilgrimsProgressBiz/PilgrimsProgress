## What is Child Bereavement Counselling? 

Child bereavement counselling is a specialized form of therapy designed to help children and adolescents cope with the loss of a loved one. This type of counselling provides a safe, supportive environment where young individuals can express their feelings, understand their emotions, and learn healthy ways to grieve. Trained counsellors use age-appropriate techniques to guide children through the complex process of mourning, ensuring they feel understood and supported during this difficult time.

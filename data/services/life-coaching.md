## What is Life Coaching? 

Life coaching is a transformative, goal-oriented process designed to help individuals achieve personal and professional fulfillment. A life coach works with clients to identify their goals, overcome obstacles, and develop actionable plans to reach their desired outcomes. Unlike therapy, which often focuses on healing past wounds, life coaching is future-focused, emphasizing growth, achievement, and self-improvement. Life coaches provide support, motivation, and accountability, empowering clients to make positive changes and live their best lives.

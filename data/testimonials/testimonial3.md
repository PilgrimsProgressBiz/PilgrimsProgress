description: 'I worked with Jonathan when my organisation brought him in to coach senior leaders as part of an internal leadership development programme. I found his input insightful, challenging, supportive and thought provoking. He was generous with his experience and helped me to develop a short and medium term career plan. Whilst I have had coaching, mentoring and leadership development at various points over the last 20 years, the input from Jonathan enabled and empowered me to get clarity, get a plan together, get brave and get going! Highly recommended.'
